# SLF_segmentation
a further segmentation of the SLF by AFQ method
Automated Fiber Quantification (AFQ) was designed by yeatmanlab 
to generate Tract Profiles of tissue properties for major fiber tracts in healthy and diseased brains. 
The documentation about the AFQ method could be found at:
https://github.com/yeatmanlab/AFQ.
To segment the superior longitudinal fascicles (SLF) into 3 branches, according to the anatomy evidence and the application by Fitzgerald in a study on patients with autism spectrum disorder,
we study on SLF-II and SLF_III separately.
Here, we offered the hand-drawn ROIs for fiber tracts segmentation and a script for diffusion metrics calculation. 
The script was run on the MATLAB 2012 and based on the script written by yeatman. The original code could be found at:
